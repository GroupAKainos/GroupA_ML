    "# Creating AWS Endpoint using Lambda with Serverless plugins\n",
    "\n",
    "Serverless developers can use the AWS Serverless Application Model framework (AWS SAM). AWS SAM creates and manages serverless applications based on templates.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inital Setup - install AWS SAM globally:\n",
    "\n",
    "Please run the following in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` brew tap aws/tap ```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` brew install aws-sam-cli ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create the service locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sam init ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the on-screen prompts:\n",
    "- Select AWS Quick Start Templates as the template source\n",
    "- Choose Image as the package type\n",
    "- Select amazon/python3.8-base as the base image\n",
    "- Enter application name: formality-api\n",
    "- Select the desired ML framework: Scikit-learn Machine Learning Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the creation of the template, I changed the following in the ./formality-api folder:\n",
    "- Amened the yaml file to suit the application\n",
    "- Amended the Dockerfile to point to the correct paths for inference code and saved models. Also added in a python command to download a nltk corpus the allow sentence tokenization.\n",
    "- Created /models folder and uploaded vectorizer and model .pkl\n",
    "- Created api folder which includes api_inference code that is used to make formality predictions\n",
    "- Amended app.py to which calls the inference code and return the sentences, formality scores and formality classification.\n",
    "- Added required dependencies to requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test the local service:\n",
    "\n",
    "Build the container: ``` sam build ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Invoke the container locally and test using a mock event.json file: ``` sam local invoke InferenceFunction --event events/event.json ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the container locally: ``` sam local start-api ```"
