    "Serverless developers can use the AWS Serverless Application Model framework (AWS SAM). AWS SAM creates and manages serverless applications based on templates.\n",

    "\n",
    "Please run the following in your terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` brew tap aws/tap ```\n",
    "\n",
    "``` brew install aws-sam-cli ```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create the service locally:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` sam init ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Follow the on-screen prompts:\n",
    "- Select AWS Quick Start Templates as the template source\n",
    "- Choose Image as the package type\n",
    "- Select amazon/python3.9-base as the base image\n",
    "- Enter application name: formality-api\n",
    "- Select the desired ML framework: Scikit-learn Machine Learning Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the creation of the template, the following has been changed in the ./formality-api folder:\n",
    "- Amened the yaml file to suit the application\n",
    "- Amended the Dockerfile to point to the correct paths for inference code and saved models. Also added in a python command to download a nltk corpus the allow sentence tokenization\n",
    "- Created /models folder and uploaded vectorizer and model .pkl\n",
    "- Created api folder which includes api_inference code that is used to make formality predictions\n",
    "- Amended app.py which uses the inference code and returns the sentences, formality scores and formality classification\n",
    "- Added required dependencies to requirements.txt\n",
    "\n",
    "### Test the local service:\n",
    "\n",
    "Build the container: ``` sam build ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Invoke the container locally and test using a mock event.json file: ``` sam local invoke InferenceFunction --event events/event.json ```\n",
